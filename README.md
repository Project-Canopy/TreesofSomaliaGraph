Once installed, we will need our schema and data files.
On TypeDB Studio, connect to TypeDB server through "Connect to TypeDB" on the bottom left.
Open the project and select/create our database, from the option on top right corner.
Once we have our database created, we initialize the schema by selecting schema and write options on the taskbar. Run the schema file and commit it.
To write our data, run the data file and commit it.
This will create our TypeDB database.
The query file has some example queries mentioned which you can run to verify working of our code.
